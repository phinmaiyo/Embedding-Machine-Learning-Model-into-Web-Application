## Introduction


This repository demonstrates the deployment of a machine learning model using FastAPI within a Docker container. The project provides a RESTful API endpoint to interact with the model predictions.


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- Python 3.x



## Setup

Install the required packages to be able to run the evaluation locally.

You need to have [`Python 3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system (**a Python version lower than 3.10**). Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: repository_name> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

The both long command-lines have a same structure, they pipe multiple commands using the symbol ` ; ` but you may manually execute them one after another.

1. **Create the Python's virtual environment** that isolates the required libraries of the project to avoid conflicts;
2. **Activate the Python's virtual environment** so that the Python kernel & libraries will be those of the isolated environment;
3. **Upgrade Pip, the installed libraries/packages manager** to have the up-to-date version that will work correctly;
4. **Install the required libraries/packages** listed in the `requirements.txt` file so that it will be allow to import them into the python's scripts and notebooks without any issue.

**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.

## Usage

1. Start the FastAPI server:

- Run the demo apps (being at the repository root):
        
  FastAPI:
    

    <!-- - sepsis prediction

          uvicorn main:app --reload  -->


  - Go to your browser at the following address, to explore the api's documentation :
        
      http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

    </tr>
</table> -->

2. Docker Deployment

- Build the Docker image:
docker build -t your_image_name .

- Run the Docker container:
docker run -d -p 80:80 your_image_name

This will run the container in detached mode, exposing it on port 80.

- Access the API:
Open your web browser or use tools like curl or Postman to access the API at http://localhost.

## API Endpoints
/predict: Endpoint to make predictions using the model. Send POST requests with necessary data for predictions.

## Project Structure
- main.py: Contains the FastAPI application files.
- src/: Includes model-related files (e.g., pickled model, preprocessing scripts).
- requirements.txt: Lists Python dependencies.
- Dockerfile: Contains instructions to build the Docker image.
